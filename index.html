				<p><span class="title">{{site.title}}</span> is the professional arm of Brisbane based developer <a href="http://blog.henrikandersson.org" target="_blank">Henrik Andersson</a>, a software developer with 10 years of experience. </p>
				<p>I work exclusively in a <a href="http://futurepositive.synearth.net/gift-economy/" target="_blank">Gift Economy</a>, which is a very unique and rewarding business model, it changes the entire business relationship. Instead of a situation where the client is skeptical and fears getting ripped off because they might not understand the process of web design and applications development and yet are being asked for a large deposit up front, causing the client to argue for the lowest possible price to lower their risk, the Gift Economy places all the risk on me.</p>
				<p>I prefer working with local and small businesses, community based organizations, progressive and non-profit organizations. Generally, I try to work with people who are trying to help other people. I am only a one person shop, and so I am rather picky at times.</p>

						<h4>Mobile First</h4>
						<blockquote>There are over 2 billion mobile web users worldwide (<a href="http://mobithinking.com/mobile-marketing-tools/latest-mobile-stats/b#mobilebroadband" target="_blank">Source</a>), more than 50% of African mobile internet users, more than 20% of users in developed markets and 59% of users in India, either never, or infrequently, access the Internet from a computer (<a href="http://mobithinking.com/mobile-marketing-tools/latest-mobile-stats/b#mobile-only" target="_blank">Source</a>).</blockquote>
						<p>The mobile market is <strong>massive</strong>, and continues to grow, as such when designing websites I take a mobile first approach, what this means is that when designing the website, I ensure that it looks spectacular on mobile devices first, before adopting it to larger screens, this is called progressive enhancement.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="column half">
						<h4>Progressive Enhancement</h4>
						<blockquote>
							Graceful Degradation is when you start developing a website adapted to desktop browsers, one issue with this approach is that it takes more effort to remove functionality to adapt a website to mobile devices.
						</blockquote>
						<p>By using the mobile first approach you ensure that your site looks good on mobile devices, you then progressively add features enhancing the website to make the it stand out from the crowd by employing functionality and techniques that would not be possible on mobile devices due to restrictions on current mobile browsers.</p>

						<h4>Designing for Brand</h4>
						<p>Application of your corporate identity style guide will inform many design decisions, from logo placement to colours and fonts.</p>

						<h4>Designing for Market</h4>
						<p>An understanding of the likes and dislikes of your target audience will inform decisions relating to colour, imagery, text tone or incorporation of specific technology.</p>

						<h4>Designing for Usability</h4>
						<p>A user-centric design approach will create an intuitive experience so as not to waste the user’s time.</p>

					<p>Do you have a work force out in the field? Is your target market more likely to access your brand while on the phone? If the answer to either of these is Yes, you want to be where your market is. You can drive your business goals further and improve your web presence by extending your website access through a mobile application.</p>
					<p>Mobile apps extend web functionality beyond your PC and into the user’s hand. They can be as simple as a mobile-friendly version of your website, or as complex as a user-directed product model with rich graphics and slick animation.</p>

				<h3 class="center"><i class="fa fa-desktop"></i> Desktop</h3>
